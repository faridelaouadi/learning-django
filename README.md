# learning-django
Messing around with the Django web framework to understand it...

Stuff learnt so far:
---

- Django project setup and structure
- MVC concept
- Models and how django abstracts alot when working with a DB
- Admin panel (modifying it and using it)
- Views and templates
- Template styling, template inheritance, and using materialize css to make stuff look pretty :)
